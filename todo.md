# vector land
- implement cosine distance using SIMD operations (ref: http://www.jamesbowman.me/post/optimising-go-code-with-assembler/)
- benchmarks...
- this would be a good excuse to go play with NEON instructions (either natively in Go assembly or via a C wrapper)

# knn-land
- prototype a tree based approach to knn search (ref: https://towardsdatascience.com/tree-algorithms-explained-ball-tree-algorithm-vs-kd-tree-vs-brute-force-9746debcd940)
- trees to try: kd-tree, ball-tree, cover-tree, vp-tree
- benchmarks / visualizations(?)
